# FoundryVTT Module

This modules tweaks a few things in the existing OSE System without modifying it directly. Current features include:
 - Tweaking how items and actions created on npc's work to be more in-line with how player items/abilities work. This should allow them to be dragged to the hotbar and be interchangable with existing pc items and actions.


## Changelog

 0.0.1 
 - Added npc tweaks to make items and actions draggable and follow the same item and action templates as pc items.
